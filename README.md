# CustomMC-Bootstrap
A complete template to create your minecraft bootstrap for your minecraft launcher

**Inspired from [Litarvan](https://github.com/Litarvan)**

## How to use
Clone the project simply in your IDE (I used IntelliJ IDEA)
Then modify some constants found in the class file 'Config.java'.
Finally, replace the textures with your own.

## Libraries used
[Swinger, Supdate, OpenlauncherLib](https://github.com/Litarvan) : Allow you to create your launcher<br/>

## How to update automatically ?
You must use S-Update server.
